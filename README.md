## 2. Company Overview

**RetailX** operates a chain of large‑format retail outlets, serving thousands of customers daily and managing over 15,000 SKUs across multiple categories (grocery, electronics, home goods, apparel). The company’s vision is to ensure product availability, minimize stock wastage, and deliver a seamless omnichannel customer experience.

---

## 3. Business Challenges

RetailX faced persistent industry challenges that hindered its growth and operational goals:

- **Inventory Imbalances:** Both overstock and frequent stock‑outs due to poor forecasting.
- **Manual Data Entry & Errors:** Spreadsheet‑based tracking led to inaccuracies and delays.
- **Warehouse Inefficiency:** Suboptimal stock rotation and utilization hampered space management.
- **High Operational Costs:** Labor‑intensive workflows increased overhead.
- **Lack of Real‑Time Visibility:** Fragmented systems prevented live inventory tracking across outlets.
- **Limited Search & Organization:** Staff faced difficulties in quickly locating or sorting inventory.
- **Scalability Constraints:** Legacy systems could not support expansion or integration with modern tools.

   - Dockerized deployment ensures scalability and reliability.
   - Automated testing and CI/CD streamline quality assurance and releases.

#### Architecture Justification

- PostgreSQL: ACID transactions for orders, adjustments, and audits.
- MongoDB: denormalized product attributes and faceted queries for fast catalog search.
- REST: stable system‑to‑system integrations with versioned endpoints.
- GraphQL: efficient UI aggregation and selective field retrieval; schema versioned per app.
- Realtime: Socket.io for low‑latency stock updates and operational alerts.

#### Security & Compliance

- Authentication/Authorization: SSO via OIDC; RBAC with least‑privilege roles.
- Encryption: TLS 1.2+ in transit; AES‑256 at rest; keys managed via KMS.
- Audit logging: administrative and inventory‑changing operations retained for 12 months.
- PII handling: minimization, masking in non‑prod, export controls (DLP).
- Backups/DR: automated, encrypted; RPO 15 minutes, RTO 2 hours; multi‑AZ.

#### Service Levels & Performance

- Availability: 99.9% monthly target.
- Latency: p95 API latency < 250 ms at 2× projected peak.
- Throughput: load tested to 1,500 RPS sustained; no data loss on single‑node failure.
- Observability: centralized logging, metrics dashboards, SLO burn‑rate alerts.

## Appendix A: Cost and ROI (12‑month view)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Cloud and licenses | $X |
| Implementation (staff/contractors) | $Y |
| Training and change management | $Z |
| Savings (holding cost, shrink, labor) | $240,000 |
| Net outcome | 9‑month payback; positive NPV in year 1 |

Replace $X/$Y/$Z with actuals; include unit economics such as cost per order before/after.
